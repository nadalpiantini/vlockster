# VLOCKSTER AI Agent Frameworks Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to using the integrated AI agent frameworks in the VLOCKSTER project:

- **Serena MCP Server**: Semantic code analysis and modification
- **Playwright Test Agents**: AI-powered test planning, generation, and healing
- **TaskMaster**: Workflow orchestration and task management
- **SuperClaude**: Enhanced Claude commands for development
- **UI/UX Enhancement System**: Modern interface improvements

## Framework Integration

### 1. Playwright Test Agents

Three AI-powered agents for automated testing:

#### Planner Agent
- **Purpose**: Explores the application and creates comprehensive test plans
- **Location**: `.claude/agents/playwright-test-planner.md`
- **Function**: Creates Markdown test plans in the `specs/` directory
- **Usage**: Use for generating test scenarios for new features

#### Generator Agent
- **Purpose**: Converts test plans into executable Playwright tests
- **Location**: `.claude/agents/playwright-test-generator.md`
- **Function**: Generates test files in the `tests/` directory
- **Usage**: Transforms Markdown plans into actual test code

#### Healer Agent
- **Purpose**: Automatically fixes failing tests
- **Location**: `.claude/agents/playwright-test-healer.md`
- **Function**: Repairs broken tests by updating locators and logic
- **Usage**: Run when tests are failing due to UI changes

### 2. Serena MCP Server

Semantic code analysis and modification system:

#### Features
- Symbol-level codebase understanding
- Multi-language support (TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java)
- Project indexing for large codebases
- Shell execution capabilities
- Dashboard for monitoring operations

#### Configuration
Located in `serena_config.yml` with optimized settings for Next.js projects.

### 3. TaskMaster System

Workflow orchestration and task management:

#### Agents
- **Code Analyzer**: Reviews code for best practices
- **UI Enhancer**: Optimizes user interfaces
- **Test Generator**: Creates automated tests
- **Accessibility Checker**: Audits accessibility compliance
- **Performance Optimizer**: Optimizes application performance

#### Workflows
- **UI Redesign Workflow**: Complete UI/UX enhancement process
- **Feature Implementation Workflow**: Development and testing pipeline

### 4. SuperClaude Commands

Custom Claude commands for development tasks:

#### Available Commands
- `/ui-redesign [component]`: Initiates comprehensive UI/UX redesign
- `/performance-check [component]`: Runs performance analysis
- `/accessibility-audit [component]`: Performs accessibility audit

## Usage Examples

### Running UI Enhancements

To enhance a specific page or component:

```bash
pnpm agents:ui-enhance
```

This will:
1. Analyze the current UI implementation
2. Generate improvement recommendations
3. Apply modern design patterns
4. Add accessibility features
5. Optimize performance

### Creating Tests

To plan tests for a new feature:

```bash
# Use the Planner agent to create a test plan
# Then the Generator to create actual tests
# And the Healer to fix any issues
```

### Performance Analysis

To analyze application performance:

```bash
pnpm agents:check
```

### Accessibility Audit

To run comprehensive accessibility checks:

1. Use the `/accessibility-audit` command in Claude
2. Or run the accessibility-checker agent directly

```

## Development Workflow

### New Feature Development
1. Create the feature implementation
2. Use Planner agent to create test plans in `specs/`
3. Use Generator agent to create tests in `tests/`
4. Use Healer agent to fix any failing tests
5. Run accessibility audit using the agent
6. Run performance analysis using the agent
7. Apply UI enhancements if needed

### UI/UX Enhancement
1. Identify the page/component to enhance
2. Use `/ui-redesign` command or run `pnpm agents:ui-enhance`
3. Review generated improvements
4. Test accessibility and performance
5. Deploy with confidence

### Code Review Process
1. Submit code changes
2. Run automated code review using agents
3. Address any issues identified
4. Run test generation for new features
5. Verify accessibility compliance
6. Approve for merge

## Best Practices

### Working with Agents
1. Always review AI-generated code before implementing
2. Test thoroughly after applying agent suggestions
3. Maintain consistent design language across the application
4. Prioritize accessibility and performance in all enhancements
5. Keep the user experience as the primary focus

### Maintaining Quality
1. Run accessibility audits regularly
2. Monitor performance metrics continuously
3. Keep test coverage high
4. Update test plans when UI changes significantly
5. Document any custom agent configurations

### Collaboration
1. Share agent-generated plans with the team
2. Review AI suggestions in code reviews
3. Update documentation when agents make changes
4. Coordinate on major UI enhancements
5. Maintain consistent workflows across the team

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
- Check `.mcp.json` configuration
- Verify Claude Desktop is properly configured
- Restart the MCP servers if needed

### Tests Failing
- Use the Healer agent to automatically fix issues
- Review generated tests for accuracy
- Update test plans if UI has changed significantly

### Performance Issues
- Run performance analysis to identify bottlenecks
- Implement suggestions from the optimization agent
- Monitor bundle size and loading times

## Future Enhancements
