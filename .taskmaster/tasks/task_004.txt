# Task ID: 4
# Title: Test Coverage Expansion - Achieve 80%+ Coverage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Expand test coverage from ~40% to 80%+ by adding unit tests for all components, integration tests for all API routes, and E2E tests for critical flows
# Details:
**Problem**: Current coverage ~40% (72 tests in 8 files).

**Approach**:
1. Add unit tests for 20+ untested components
2. Expand API integration tests for all 13 routes
3. Add E2E flow tests for critical journeys
4. Set up coverage reporting and thresholds

**Components**: AdminUserActions, AdminReportActions, PayPalButton, ProjectBackingCard, BrandHeader, CookieConsent, Pagination, +13 more

**E2E Flows**: Video upload, project creation/backing, admin moderation, community interaction

# Test Strategy:
Write tests incrementally. Run coverage reports after each batch. Focus on critical paths first. Add CI coverage checks.
